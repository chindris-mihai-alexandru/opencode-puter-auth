### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed plugin load error "Cannot call a class constructor without new"
  - OpenCode's plugin loader iterates all exports and calls them as functions
  - Removed `PuterClient` and `PuterAuthManager` class exports from index.ts
  - Now only exports the `PuterAuthPlugin` function (matching antigravity plugin pattern)
  - Classes are still usable internally but not exposed via package exports
